This project started with a blank mind no idea.
But my school friend told me to listen to song "Cabinet Man" by "Lemon Demon".From there we did some modifications and laid the plot for this project.And, I implemented that idea to make this project.

I would like to thanks my songwriter P4LE C4RR0TZ (wished to be unnamed) for allowing me to use his songs in my game.

This project was exclusively made for "Google Code to Learn 2018".
